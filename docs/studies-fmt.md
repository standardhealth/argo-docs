Hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients, defined as patients over the age of 18 admitted for inpatient care with either:  

* A [clinical diagnosis of COVID-19](/docs/vocabulary#confirmed-covid-19-infection-vs) or a positive [polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory test result for SARSCoV-2]() – either within 14 days prior to hospital admission – and a [respiratory diagnosis](/docs/vocabulary#respiratory-condition-vs) associated with the hospitalization.
* Either a [clinical diagnosis of COVID-19](/docs/vocabulary#confirmed-covid-19-infection-vs) or a positive [PCR laboratory test result for SARSCoV-2](/docs/vocabulary#pcr-sarscov-2-qualitative-test), either within 7 days after hospital admission.  

**Exclusions:**

### Outcomes

* [Inpatient Death](/docs/cohorts#inpatient-death) occurring between hospital admission through earliest of (death, discharge, 30 days of hospital admission)

### Statistical Analysis

* Descriptive statistics
* Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model, using elastic net for variable selection for reduced model
