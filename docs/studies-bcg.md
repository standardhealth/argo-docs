<h1>Intravesical <span>BCG</span></h1>

**RESEARCH QUESTION: How does prior vaccination with Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) affect the infection with COVID-19?**

### Background

BCG has been suggested as a protective factor against COVID-19. Before randomized clinical trials read out, a retrospective observational study can provide insight into this hypothesis.

### Study Design

The study examines the effect of prior intravesical BCG vaccination on COVID-19 infections. The study involves two study groups (those with and without prior intravesical BCG), as depicted below:

Confounding factors considered are:

1. Age
2. Gender
3. Comorbidities
4. Facility (reporting organization)
