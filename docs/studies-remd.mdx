# Remdesivir

**RESEARCH QUESTION: For patients with new COVID-19 infection, how does the addition of Remdesivir affect the outcomes (1) severe disease (indicated by mechanical ventilation) and (2) inpatient death?**

### Background

Remdesivir are currently under study as possible treatments for COVID-19. Before randomized clinical trials read out, a retrospective observational study can provide insight into the efficacy of this drug.

### Study Design

The study examines the effect of initiation of Remdesivir in hospitalized COVID-19 patients on disease severity. The study involves two study groups (those receiving or not receiving Remdesivir), as depicted below:

**Study Period**: January 1, 2020 - Present (Index date: `COVID-19-positive-date`)

![Remdesivir cohort pathways](remd_cohorts.png)

Three outcomes are considered:

1. Discharge without being placed on mechanical ventilation during stay
2. Discharge after invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during stay
3. Inpatient death

These outcomes correspond to increasing levels disease severity. The study uses mechanical ventilation as a proxy for severe but non-fatal disease. The outcome is retrospective over the entire patient visit and capture the worst severity of illness during the visit. For example:

* Patient is put on a ventilator (level 2) and then succumbs to the disease (level 3); the outcome is level 3 (death).
* Patient is temporarily put on a ventilator (level 2), then taken off the ventilator (level 1) and discharged; the outcome level 2.

### Study Populations

* **Entry Cohort**:
  * Age at `COVID-19-positive-date` ≥ 18 years AND
  * `COVID-19-positive-date` after Jan 1, 2020 AND
  * `COVID-19-related hospitalization`
* **Target Cohort**:
  * Entry Cohort AND
  * `Inpatient-Remdesivir-use` AND NOT `Prior-Remdesivir-use` [1]
* **Control Cohort**:
  * Entry Cohort AND
  * NOT `Inpatient-Remdesivir-use` AND NOT `Prior-Remdesivir-use` [1]

### Definitions

* `COVID-19-positive` [2]:
  * Any clinical diagnosis [3] code in set `C19HCC Confirmed COVID-19 infection` OR
  * `Positive` or `detected` result from any test in set `C19HCC SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Laboratory Test` [4] OR
  * `Positive` or `detected` result from any test in set `C19HCC SARS-related Qualitative Laboratory Test` [4]
* `COVID-19-positive-date`: earliest date of `COVID-19-positive` [5]
* `Hospitalization`:
  * encounter with class or type like `inpatient encounter` AND
  * encounter status like `completed`
* `COVID-19-related-hospitalization`: [6]
  * `COVID-19-positive-date` during `hospitalization` OR
  * (`hospitalization` up to 14 days after `COVID-19-positive-date`) AND (any clinical or billing diagnosis of `Respiratory Condition` associated with the hospitalization [7])
* `Prior-Remdesivir-use`:
  * `Hydroxychloroquine` on admission medication list or outpatient medication list
* `Inpatient-Remdesivir-use`:
  * `Hydroxychloroquine` medication administration during `COVID-19-related-hospitalization`
    * Includes any dose, form, duration of Remdesivir
    * Includes any level of disease severity while on Remdesivir
    * Includes patients on other medications

#### Study Cohort Examples

Person A (included in study):
* Presents with fever and difficulty breathing
* Admitted with diagnosis of suspected COVID-19
* Tests positive during hospital stay (even if results received after discharge)
* No history of Remdesivir usage

Person B (excluded from study):
* Presents with fever and difficulty breathing
* Admitted with diagnosis of suspected COVID-19
* Tests positive during hospital stay
* Taking Remdesivir for lupus

Person C (included in study):
* Has fever and cough
* Swabbed for COVID-19, sent home
* Test results positive
* Arrives at hospital 10 days later with dyspnea
* Admitted
* No history of Remdesivir usage

Person D (excluded from study):
* Presents with fever, difficulty breathing
* Admitted with admission diagnosis of suspected COVID-19
* Tests negative for COVID-19
* No history of Remdesivir usage

Person E (included from study):
* Admitted to hospital for congestive heart failure
* During stay, experiences fever and cough
* During stay, tests positive for COVID-19
* No history of Remdesivir usage

Person F (excluded from study):
* Asymptomatic
* Tests positive for COVID-19 during outpatient population screening
* Admitted to hospital 5 days later for trauma injury
* No history of Remdesivir usage

Person F (included in study):
* Has fever and cough
* Swabbed for COVID-19, sent home
* Test results positive
* Arrives at hospital 22 days later with dyspnea
* Admitted with suspected COVID-19
* Receives clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 as inpatient

### Outcomes

* **Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV)**:
  * `Invasive mechanical ventilation` procedure during `COVID-19-related-hospitalization` OR
  * Evidence mechanical ventilation in ICU flowsheet documentation (e.g. ventilator mode change)[8]

* **COVID-19 Inpatient Death**:
  * `COVID-19 related hospitalization` discharge disposition like `expired` OR date of death is during `COVID-19 related hospitalization`

#### Notes:

[2] Study includes confirmed cases only<br/>
[3] A clinical diagnosis can be any diagnosis associated with an encounter, such as chief complaint, admitting diagnosis, working diagnosis, final diagnosis, or discharge diagnosis. It can also be a problem list entry.<br/>
[4] There may be local value sets/groupers for laboratory tests to detect SARS-CoV-2. Only PCR and NAAT tests with qualitative results should be considered for this purpose. See [C19HCC SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Laboratory Test](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113762.1.4.1032.109/expansion/Latest) and [C19HCC SARS-related Qualitative Laboratory Test]() for details on inclusions and exclusions.<br/>
[5] The relevant date for laboratory test is the specimen collection data, not when results are reported. Laboratory order date can be used when specimen collection date is not available.<br/>
[6] This definition includes patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during a hospital visit even if the reason for hospitalization is not COVID-related; e.g., patients with undetected COVID-19 admitted for other reasons, and nosocomial COVID-19 infections ​<br/>
[7] Serves a confirmation that hospital admission is related to COVID-19 infection (as opposed to broken arm, etc.)<br/>
[8] ICU flowsheet data may not be accessible to all data partners
