# STUDIES

## Roles

The COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition (C19HCC) is a private-sector led response that brings together healthcare organizations, technology firms, nonprofits, academia, and startups to preserve the healthcare delivery system and help protect U.S. populations. C19HCC convenes and facilitates the entire study process.

### Researchers

With representatives from academia, health systems, electronic health record (EHR) vendors, and health analytics providers, researchers determine the study design and analyze data reported by Aggregators.

### Aggregators

Aggregators are EHR vendors and health analytics providers who have patient-level data collected from one or more Health Systems. In some cases, the Aggregators and Health Systems can be one in the same.

### Health Systems

Health Systems are the original source of patient-level data.

## Study Configurations

The timeline or flow of the study is depicted below. When possible, existing data use agreements (DUAs) between the Aggregators and Health Systems have been utilized. Aggregators work with Researchers to standardize cohort definitions at a logical level. As data holders, the Aggregators know what data is available and the approximate size of proposed cohorts to assure any proposed cohorts are implementable. Once established, the cohort definitions are adapted by the Aggregators to their local terminology and data representations. The resulting queries are executed against the Aggregators' databases, without sharing patient-level data with Researchers. Results are returned as counts for each defined cohort.
