## Clinical Data Standardization for COVID-19: Call to Action

The **COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition** (C19HCC) is a collaborative private-industry response to novel coronavirus. Our mission is to save lives by providing real-time learning to preserve healthcare delivery and protect populations. We’re bringing together the best, brightest minds, assets and insights from across private industry to coordinate a response. We’re sharing resources, sharing plans, and working together.

## Harmonized Analytics

The clinical data needed to derive insights on COVID-19 screening and management is a moving target. Many organizations are defining data elements and codes to represent COVID-19-related data. We can unlock at-scale analytics for COVID-19 to produce valuable clinical insights by creating:

* A base set of data requirements for clinical data providers to 1) scope and guide clinical data extraction with minimal effort, transformations, and assumptions; and 2) feed a broad set of analytics questions with a single stroke and minimal assumptions.

* COVID-19 cohorts provide standardized definitions for relevant metrics and populations of interest. Following these definitions assures consistent metrics and comparable cohorts.

We welcome clinical data providers and analytics teams to share their needs and priorities to guide and contribute to this effort!

* Explore the details of the COVID-19 clinical data set in the **[C19HCC Data Dictionary Viewer](dictionary).**

* Explore COVID-19 value sets in the **[C19HCC Vocabulary](vocabulary).**

* Explore standardized cohort definitions in the **[C19HCC Cohorts](cohorts).**

If you have any questions about the cohorts, vocabulary or data dictionary, please contact us at C19hcc@mitre.org.
