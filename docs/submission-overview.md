## Clinical Data Standardization for COVID-19: Call to Action

The **COVID-19 Healthcare Coalition** (C19HCC) is a collaborative private-industry response to novel coronavirus. Our mission is to save lives by providing real-time learning to preserve healthcare delivery and protect populations. We’re bringing together the best, brightest minds, assets and insights from across private industry to coordinate a response. We’re sharing resources, sharing plans, and working together.

## Data Dictionary

The clinical data needed to derive insights on COVID-19 screening and management is a moving target. Many organizations are defining data elements and codes to represent COVID-19-related data. We can unlock at-scale analytics for COVID-19 to produce valuable clinical insights by creating:

* A base set of data requirements for clinical data providers to 1) scope and guide clinical data extraction with minimal effort, transformations, and assumptions; and 2) feed a broad set of analytics questions with a single stroke and minimal assumptions.

* Standardized definitions and transformation logic, where applicable, for COVID-19 clinically relevant data elements for consumers of clinical data to accelerate analytics efforts and increase transparency and comparability of derived and aggregate data.

We welcome clinical data providers and analytics teams to share their needs and priorities to guide and contribute to this effort!
