<h1>Convalescent <span>Serum</span></h1>

**RESEARCH QUESTION: For patients with new COVID-19 infection, how does the addition of convalescent serum (CS) affect the outcomes (1) severe disease (indicated by mechanical ventilation) and (2) inpatient death?**

### Background

Convalescent Serum (CS) is currently under study as possible treatments for COVID-19. Before randomized clinical trials read out, a retrospective observational study can provide insight into the efficacy of this treatment.

### Study Design

**Study Period**: April 1, 2020 - Present
**Index date: [COVID-19-positive-date](/docs/cohorts#covid-19-positive-date)**

The study examines the effect of CS treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients on disease severity. The study involves two study groups (those receiving or not receiving CS), as depicted below:

Four outcomes are considered:

1. Discharge without invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) during stay
2. Discharge after IMV during stay
3. Inpatient death without IMV during stay
4. Inpatient death following IMV during stay

The study uses mechanical ventilation as a proxy for severe but non-fatal disease. The outcome is retrospective over the entire patient visit and capture the worst severity of illness during the visit. For example:

* Patient is put on a ventilator (category 2) and then succumbs to the disease (category 4); the outcome is category 4 (death).
* Patient is temporarily put on a ventilator (category 2), then taken off the ventilator (category 1) and discharged; the outcome category 2.

The protocol only considers laboratory-confirmed cases. It specifically focuses on severe or life-threatening COVID-19 or judged by a healthcare provider to be at high risk of progression to severe or life-threatening disease.

### Study Populations

* **Entry Cohort**:
  * Age at [COVID-19-positive-date](/docs/cohorts#covid-19-positive-date) ≥ 18 years AND
  * [COVID-19-positive-date](/docs/cohorts#covid-19-positive-date) after Jan 1, 2020 AND
  * [COVID-19-related hospitalization](/docs/cohorts#covid-19-related-hospitalization)
* **Target Cohort**:
  * Entry Cohort AND [Inpatient CS Use](/docs/cohorts#inpatient-cs-use)
* **Control Cohort**:
  * Entry Cohort AND NOT [Inpatient CS use](/docs/cohorts#inpatient-cs-use)

### Outcomes

* **Invasive Mechanical Ventilation (IMV)**:
  * [Invasive Mechanical Ventilation](/docs/cohorts#invasive-mechanical-ventilation) during [COVID-19 Related Hospitalization](/docs/cohorts#covid-19-related-hospitalization)

* **COVID-19 Inpatient Death**:
  * [Inpatient Death](/docs/cohorts#inpatient-death) during [COVID-19 Related Hospitalization](/docs/cohorts#covid-19-related-hospitalization)


### Notes:
[2] Study includes confirmed cases only<br/>
[3] A clinical diagnosis can be any diagnosis associated with an encounter, such as chief complaint, admitting diagnosis, working diagnosis, final diagnosis, or discharge diagnosis. It can also be a problem list entry.<br/>
[4] There may be local value sets/groupers for laboratory tests to detect SARS-CoV-2. Only PCR and NAAT tests with qualitative results should be considered for this purpose. See [SARS-CoV-2 Qualitative Laboratory Test](/docs/vocabulary#sars-cov-2-qualitative-labortory-test) and [SARS-related Qualitative Laboratory Test](/docs/vocabulary#sars-related-qualitative-laboratory-test) for details on inclusions and exclusions.<br/>
[5] The relevant date for laboratory test is the specimen collection data, not when results are reported. Laboratory order date can be used when specimen collection date is not available.<br/>
[6] This definition includes patients diagnosed with COVID-19 during a hospital visit even if the reason for hospitalization is not COVID-related; e.g., patients with undetected COVID-19 admitted for other reasons, and nosocomial COVID-19 infections ​<br/>
[7] Serves a confirmation that hospital admission is related to COVID-19 infection (as opposed to broken arm, etc.)<br/>
[8] ICU flowsheet data may not be accessible to all data partners
